/**
 * @file hal_uc.h
 * @brief Highest level include for uC HAL.
 *
 * This file is the header that should be used to obtain the functions to control 
 * the microcontroller and it's peripherals, whose peripheral map is defined by 
 * `hal_uc_map.h`. HAL_uC brings in the underlying drivers provided by the base 
 * libraries (preferably manufacturer provided) and provides wrappers around it to 
 * form a controlled interface. The definitions within `hal_uc_map.h` determine 
 * which underlying interface / peripheral should be used to provide the required 
 * functionality.
 * 
 * General applications will have to include this file after `application.h` is 
 * imported. The controlled HAL_uC interface should be preferred over the 
 * underlying driver APIs (such as `driverlib` for MSP430), even though both 
 * versions exist in the namespace. This will allow easier migration and 
 * code-sharing with other ICs and/or platforms.
 * 
 * The `hal_uc` folder should ideally be portable across all implementations. MCU 
 * specific implementation goes into `uc-impl` and would ideally be portable to 
 * entire MCU families, taking resource information from `application.h`. Some 
 * graceful way to bow out should be found when these functions are not provided 
 * by a certain uC. 
 * 
 * The HAL layer provides only function prototypes and should have zero bytecode 
 * footprint. The mapping from the HAL layer to the implementation layer is 
 * determined by the `(module)_impl.h` and `(module)_impl.c` files within the 
 * implementation layer (the `uc-impl` folder). Additionally, `(module)_handlers.h`
 * and `(module)_handlers.c` provide inmplementations of relevant IRQ handlers. 
 * These files may be relatively less portable.
 * 
 * One-time or low-frequency use functions, such as init and setup functions, will
 * typically be included in `(module)_impl.c` and will be compiled as part of the 
 * HAL_uC library. Functions that are expected to be used more often in time-critical
 * settings go instead into `(module)_impl.h` as `static inline` functions to minimize
 * function call overhead. The split between inline and regular functions is a 
 * somewhat subjective and application dependent one. A reasonable split is attempted 
 * here, but if your use case is considerable different, you may need to modify the
 * implementation layer to suit your particular needs.
